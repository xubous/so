# Virtual OS in C++

⚠️ **Work in Progress!**  

This is a little experiment creating a **virtual operating system** in C++. The goal is to play around with concepts like CPU, memory, storage, processes, and applications — all simulated.

## About

Still **under development**, so many things are just getting started. The main idea is to explore how different parts of an OS could interact and work together, in a fun and educational way.

## Project Status

- 💡 Basic OS concept: CPU, memory, storage, and users.
- 🛠 Data structures in place (lists, trees, etc.).
- 🔄 Interactive terminal menu.
- ⚠️ Many features not implemented yet.
- 🚧 Ongoing development — nothing is final.

## How to Test
