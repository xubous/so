# Virtual OS in C++

⚠️ **Work in Progress!**  

This is a little experiment creating a **virtual operating system** in C++. The goal is to play around with concepts like CPU, memory, storage, processes, and applications — all simulated.

---

## About

Still **under development**, so many things are just getting started. The main idea is to explore how different parts of an OS could interact and work together, in a fun and educational way.

---

## Project Status

- 💡 Basic OS concept: CPU, memory, storage, and users.
- 🛠 Data structures in place (lists, trees, etc.).
- 🔄 Interactive terminal menu.
- ⚠️ Many features not implemented yet.
- 🚧 Ongoing development — nothing is final.# Virtual OS in C++

## About

Still **under development**, so many things are just getting started. The main idea is to explore how different parts of an OS could interact and work together, in a fun and educational way.  

The project simulates:

- **CPU**: Handles process scheduling and basic execution logic.
- **Memory**: Simulates RAM allocation and memory management.
- **Storage**: Simulated storage (HDD/SSD) for file management.
- **Processes**: Creation, management, and basic operations.
- **Applications**: Simulated programs that run within the OS.
- **Terminal interface**: Interactive CLI to test features.

## How to Test

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <REPO_URL>
   cd virtual-os-cpp

    Compile the project using your C++ compiler:

g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o virtual_os

Run the OS simulation:

./virtual_os
